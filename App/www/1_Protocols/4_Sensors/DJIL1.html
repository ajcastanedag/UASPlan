<h2>Micasense Altum</h2>
<p align="justify">
  The Micasens Altum is a multispectral camera that captures images across multiple wavelength bands, which can be used for various applications
  such as precision agriculture, mineral exploration, and environmental monitoring. The camera typically uses multiple image sensors to capture
  data in each band, such as the visible, near-infrared, or short-wave infrared regions. The Altum camera is designed to be mounted on a drone
  or other platform for aerial imaging. However, it can also be used as a stationary device for ground-based imaging. The camera can generate
  detailed information about the reflective properties of the target, enabling applications such as crop health analysis, mineral mapping, and
  object recognition. It can also be used to measure temperature and thermal infrared imaging. The Altum camera has a high-resolution sensor and 
  advanced optics to produce high-quality images. The camera typically outputs image data in various formats, such as TIFF or JPEG, and may also
  include additional data, such as GPS coordinates and altitude information. Additionally, the Altum can be integrated with other sensors, such as
  LiDAR, allowing for a more comprehensive data collection and analysis.

  The Micasense Downwelling Light Sensor 2 (<em title="Downwelling Light Sensor 2" style="color:rgb(253,163,126)">DLS 2</em>) is a sensor that
  works with the multispectral camera and must be included in the setup to measure the light condition changes during the data acquisition. This
  sensor measures the amount of light that is downwelling or coming down from the sky in a given area. It is typically used to measure the amount of
  light available for photosynthesis in crops, which can be used to analyze crop health and predict crop yields. The DLS 2 sensor is designed
  to be mounted on a drone or other platform for aerial measurements, and it can also be used as a stationary device for ground-based
  measurements. The sensor has a wide field of view, allowing it to measure the light over a large area and is equipped with advanced optics
  to produce accurate and reliable measurements. The sensor typically outputs data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON, and may include
  additional data, such as GPS coordinates and altitude information. The DLS 2 sensor can be used with other sensors, such as multispectral
  cameras, to capture a more comprehensive data set and extract valuable insights. The sensor is also compatible with the Altum Camera, which
  allows you to conduct simultaneous measurements of light and reflectance, providing more information to analyze. The following graph shows
  a sketch of the DSL 2 sensor and the Altum multispectral camera. </p>
