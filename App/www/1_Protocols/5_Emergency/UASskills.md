# UAS skills - situation that might happen

# Introduction...

* take care of the mode of the controller (it should be P)

* take care of the antennas they should be parallel

* animals: take care of dogs: you should go up with the drone if a dog approaches the landing spot
          if a bird is approaching your drone in the air - go down
          
* connection loss

* check the security default settings (we need to define them, e.g. obstacle avoidance) - especially the height of your "return to home" mode!
