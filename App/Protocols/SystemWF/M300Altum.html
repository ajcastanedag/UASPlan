  planning to the processing of the data going through all to-dos before the flights and the tasks you must perform to ensure the success
  of your mission. When a word is highlighted, it contains an additional explanation when hovering the
  mouse on top of it; for example: <em title="A short explanation will pop-up" style="color:rgb(253,163,126)">term</em>. Additionally,

<!---   About the sensor   --->
<h2>Micasense Altum</h2>
<p align="justify">
  The Micasens Altum is a multispectral camera that captures images across multiple wavelength bands, which can be used for various applications
  such as precision agriculture, mineral exploration, and environmental monitoring. The camera typically uses multiple image sensors to capture
  data in each band, such as the visible, near-infrared, or short-wave infrared regions. The Altum camera is designed to be mounted on a drone
  or other platform for aerial imaging. However, it can also be used as a stationary device for ground-based imaging. The camera can generate
  detailed information about the reflective properties of the target, enabling applications such as crop health analysis, mineral mapping, and
  object recognition. It can also be used to measure temperature and thermal infrared imaging. The Altum camera has a high-resolution sensor and 
  advanced optics to produce high-quality images. The camera typically outputs image data in various formats, such as TIFF or JPEG, and may also
  include additional data, such as GPS coordinates and altitude information. Additionally, the Altum can be integrated with other sensors, such as
  LiDAR, allowing for a more comprehensive data collection and analysis. Overall, the Micasens Altum is a powerful, versatile camera that can be
  used for many applications. It will allow you to capture spectral information and extract valuable insights from your images.
  <br><br>
  The Micasense Downwelling Light Sensor 2 (<em title="Downwelling Light Sensor 2" style="color:rgb(253,163,126)">DLS 2</em>) is a sensor that
  measures the amount of light that is downwelling or coming down from the sky in a given area. It is typically used to measure the amount of
  light available for photosynthesis in crops, which can be used to analyze crop health and predict crop yields. The DLS 2 sensor is designed
  to be mounted on a drone or other platform for aerial measurements, and it can also be used as a stationary device for ground-based
  measurements. The sensor has a wide field of view, allowing it to measure the light over a large area and is equipped with advanced optics
  to produce accurate and reliable measurements. The sensor typically outputs data in various formats, such as CSV or JSON, and may include
  additional data, such as GPS coordinates and altitude information. The DLS 2 sensor can be used with other sensors, such as multispectral
  cameras, to capture a more comprehensive data set and extract valuable insights. The sensor is also compatible with the Altum Camera, which
  allows you to conduct simultaneous measurements of light and reflectance, providing more information to analyze.

  For this setup, the software <em title="Universal Ground Control System" style="color:rgb(253,163,126)">UgCs</em> is used. This
  software controls and operates uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) remotely. UGCS includes hardware (computer - tablet) and software
  components, such as a control station, communication equipment, and navigation systems that allow an operator to remotely start,
  pause, stop, resume, and restart missions. The software is also used during flight to monitor the UAV's movements, sensors, and
  payloads. The workflow of mission planning consists of three major steps:

**Aircraft set-up**


---
**Camera set-up**
* Mount Camera on Sky port by aligning the the longest flap 
* Mount DLS 2 sensor on the aircraft
* Connect DLS 2 to skyport 
* Connect blue cable (altum / skyport)
* Insert memory (USB)
* Turn aircraft on and wait until the camera has finished initializing (around 2 min). 
* Once the DLS sensor is blinking green, you can proceed.
* With a phone or laptop, login into the camere wifi:
	* Name: Altum_ALO5-1934088-SC
	* Password: micasense
* Open any browser of your choice and type: **192.168.10.254**
* This will take you to the main camera menu called "HOME", from it you can visualize the status of the camera:
	* <div title="This will report your available and maximum storage space, as well as the file system (e.g. FAT32).">Storage</div>
	* <div title="Indicates the amount of satellites that are detected and currently being used. There is also an area at the bottom of the page that shows the signal strength of detected satellites.">GPS Sats</div>
	* <div title="Will be green if DLS is powered and communicating with the camera.">DLS Status</div>
	* <div title="Will initially be set at UNIX time (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). Once GPS has a lock, this will update to the current date/time in UTC (Universal Time). It cannot be changed to a different time zone, as many data processing programs rely on UTC for accurate calculations.">Time</div>
	* <div title="This is the detected location coming from GPS, written in Decimal Degrees. ">Location</div>
	* <div title="This indicates your current altitude in Mean Seal Level (MSL) and Above Ground Level (AGL). The altitude AGL reported on the status page is an estimate based on the initial GPS lock received by the camera. If the initial GPS lock is not very accurate, it's possible for the AGL reported to be significantly off, especially as a better GPS lock is established over time. Powering the camera off and then back on will reset the ground estimate.">Altitude</div>
	* <div title="Current speed detected in meters per second. These unit of measurement cannot be converted at this time.">Speed</div>
	* <div title="Your current magnetic heading. If properly calibrated, you can check the reading against a handheld compass to verify its accuracy. We recommend re-calibrating the compass regularly, but at the very least when it has been moved to another location on the aircraft, or if you are flying in a different time zone (which would slightly alter the magnetic heading).">Heading</div>
	* <div title="This shows your current setting for your Automatic Triggering Mode. ">Capture Config</div>

**⚠ You must verify that all items are <span style="color:rgb(26,175,79)">green</span> colored to proceed.**


* Access the configuration tab and under the Basic Configuration section select the following parameters:
	* Auto-Capture Mode: Overlap
	* Along-Track Overlap: 80%
	* Target Alt: 80m (This may depend on your selected flight altitud, leave this parameter as 10 meters less than your chosen flight altitud).

* Locate the calibration panel in a clear (no shadeded) flat area.
* Stand in front of the panel with the sun to your back holding the aircraft with the camera in front of you.
* Take one large step to the right or left to avoid any shade on the panel. 
* Access the live-view tab, tick the "Streaming" option and then click on the QR button. 	 
* The camera will start beeping trying to find the QR code of the panel you located previously on the ground and it will take a calibration image. The sucess of this operation will be indicated by a high pitch sound from the camrera.
* 

---
**Flight**
* Deploy the aircraft using the Pilot 2 App

---
**Post-Flight**
* Once the aircraft has landed, access the browser interface of the camera once more and take a second calibration image. (Repeat previous steps)


Disconnect data cable (Blue) bz pressing on both sides
Disconnect data cable from sky port by pressing on the flap and gently pulling
safe the cable on the box 
unpluy usb and safe it on the box
unplug DLS 2
