Wingtra Gen II - Altum
=======================

In this document you will find all the proceadures to...

Please note: the wingtra system is very sensible to windspeed. The max windspeed recommended to fly is 8m/s. 


Please note: the format of the SDcards for the Wingtra system is ExFat - if it comes to an unusual behaviour please check the formating of the SDcards first. You can do this also in the field by ...

on the field:
- set up Emlid station (optional) - turn it on to start recording
- set up GSP (optional)

- set up Aircraft  by adding white tail to main body (Numb facing top of Aircraft). Do not touch sensors. Changing sensor is possible at this stage with bristol key (included in the wingtra box)

- place Wingtra on starting spot. Check on windspeed and wind direction. Wingtra needs to be located paralell to the wind direction (least air resistance / minimal area is exposed to the wind in order not to ...) max windspeed 8 m/s !!!

- connect batteries (use battries with matching colors): the half circle on the battery matches the half circle on aircraft.
- Connect USB Power (next to batteries)
- Add orange wingtra nose (Magnetic click) remove sensor cover
- Turn Wingtra tablet on and add antenna on the right side (but then how are you holding the tablet? is the power button top left???) then connect cable.
- Open the Wingtra hub app on the tablet  and select your preplanned mission.
- after you selected your mission the app will guide you through a checklist. 
note: if the Altum camera is not connecting (green buttion in the checklist is not appearing), try to unplug the USB C cable and plug it in again

If you are using the Altum sensor, you need to calibrate the images BEFORE and AFTER your flight (this is MANDATORY, otherwise your data results are ...:

- Take the Micasense Panel and place it on the ground. No shades allowed!
- Lift Wingtra over panel (be careful with the flaps!) and click the button (which one???) (top right) - manual way to check the image 

-  Connect to hotspot of Altum via mobile phone by connecting to the wifi  Altum-LAO6 for micasense.
Open chrome and go to 192.168.10.254
Menu opens -> go to camera tab -> image should be here. If not;
Relocate aircraft on top of the panel and click on capture.
-  Store panel back in a safe place 

 Check again position of Aircraft with respect to wind direction before start.
 
- Click through checklist
- Execute mission

- take another calibration image (MANDATORY)


If you want to change the sensor: 
- make sure UAS is turned off
- disconnect the USB Cable of the sensor in the Wingtra
- unscrew until you hear a click sound (sensor will not fall out)
- take sensor (and USB cable) out
- screw new sensor back in and connect USB
