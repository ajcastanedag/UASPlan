Phantom 4
=======================


Please note: the Phantom 4 is currently not working stable! Please get back to us for further instructions before you go out into the field.


Equipment: Phantom 4 box + corresponding tablet (not included in box!)

set up Phantom: 

- install propellars on the drone - take care on the colouring of the propellars and rotor, respectively
- insert battery (check on battery status by clicking once on it, always go with fully loaded batteries)
- unfold the remote controllor and clamp and connect the tablet to it 

turning on in this order works best:
first drone, then controller 
wait for connection 
when connected: open your planned mission in Pix4D, otherwise start again with drone - controller

go for your flight mission

add optional RTK
