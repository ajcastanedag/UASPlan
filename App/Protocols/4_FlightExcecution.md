# Flight Excecution
==============================================


In general: 
- look for an open space and a flat surface to set up the drone, use the landing pad 
- you should choose "highest" area of your AOI for your flight mission (stable connection)

- Use the flags and cones to secure your start and landing spot as well as your surrounding (e.g. to warn cars when you are close to a street)

- know your system: how to interrupt the flight mission, how to return to home,... 


check the security default settings (we need to define them, e.g. obstacle avoidance) - especially the height of your "return to home" mode!
