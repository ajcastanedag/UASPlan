# Introduction

Welcome to the UAS interactive platform. Here you will find all the information needed not only to execute UAS flights but also to process the information that you collect. In this section you can find some manuals and protocols for all the equipment that is available at the department. On the left side

Reminders to operate all the listed equipment:

-   Processed with the markdown package, which transforms it into HTML.
-   The output is included in the web page.

-> calendar and usage must be included (add note: long processing times are preferred overnight or at weekends)
-> include overview of systems and sensors

### Admin stuff before you go into planning

take care of:

\* Dienstreiseantrag \* book bus / bike if needed \* flight permission \* driving permission (e.g. for national parks) if needed

and don't forget to have your pilot license with you.

Additional note to "how to pack the bus"

We encountered that it is really helpful to get in contact with the general emergency service (german: Leitstelle) before you execute the flight mission to keep everyone safe. They are very often not aware that drones follow a predefined route (your executed flight mission) and stay longer in the air. Therefore the protocol states to call the Leitstelle. Please inform yourself on the number of the Leitstelle for other regions (outside WÃ¼rzburg) and contact them prior you go to the field to introduce you and the planned work and contact them when you are in the field prior to the flight.

### To get ready for the field

in the following we will guide you through the different steps to get ready for the field. This includes mission planning, taking care of the equipment, get everything organised, packing lists and saftey protocols

**Please note:** printing and cross checking the emergency protocol, equipment and packing list is mandatory
