# \# Introduction

Welcome to the UAS interactive platform.

Here you will find all the information needed not only to execute UAS flights but also to handle and store the data properly as well as to process the information that you collected.

On this side you can find some useful manuals and protocols for our equipment that is available at the department, as well as packing and checklists to keep you save in the field.

In a first step you need to choose your aircraft system and sensor. Afterwards you define your project location (AOI), plan your mission, take care of the equipment, go to the field and load the data through this app into your (automatically) pre-created folders and run a first analysis.

Some additional notes before we go into planning:

there are some admin related things you need to take care of:

-   Dienstreiseantrag
-   book bus / bike if needed (please be reminded to fill out the "Fahrtenbuch" when you take the bus)
-   flight permission (you should have a copy with you)
-   driving permission (e.g. for national parks) if needed
-   check the weather carefully! especially the windspeed is limiting the days you can actually go into the field (some useful websites are: meteoblue.com or windy.com or the app UAV forecast)

and don't forget to have your pilot license with you.

We encountered that it is really helpful to get in contact with the general emergency service (german: Leitstelle) before you execute the flight mission to keep everyone safe. They are very often not aware that drones follow a predefined route (your executed flight mission) and stay longer in the air. Therefore the protocol states to call the Leitstelle. Please inform yourself on the number of the Leitstelle for other regions (outside WÃ¼rzburg) and contact them prior you go to the field to introduce you and the planned work and contact them when you are in the field prior to the flight.


### Get ready for the field

in the following we will inform you on the different steps to get ready for the field. This includes mission planning, taking care of the equipment, get everything organised, packing lists and saftey protocols. This introductory page is to inform you about every step. The acutally planning starts on the next page (via the button create in the menu bar on top)

**Please note:** printing and cross checking the emergency protocol, equipment and packing list is mandatory



## **Let's start!**

On this side you will find all the information needed to make informed decision on what equipment you need to choose and what you need to take with you in the field. If you click on "create" in the menu bar, the actual planning starts.

You will need to choose an aircraft and sensor and select RTK if needed.

Here is a list of our equipment and combinations of sensors you find under the Aircraft and sensor buttons above:

(-\> examples need to be filled in in the following section)

-   Mavic - mainly used to create media
-   Phantom 4 - mapping drone (Photogrammetry)
-   DJI M600 - Altum - multispektral
-   DJI M600 - MXDual - multispektral
-   DJI M600 - LiAirV - lidar
-   DJI M300 - Altum - mulitspektral
-   DJI M300 - MxDual - multispetral
-   DJI M300 - L1 - lidar
-   DJI M300 - H20T - Thermal and RGB
-   Wingtra - RX1RII - RGB
-   Wingtra - Altum - multispektral
-   Lidar Backpack

RTK (tbd: explain RTK) is mandatory if you go with a lidar sensor and can be useful for mapping - depending on your research
question. If you have questions please write us an email: [uasuniwue\@gmail.com](mailto:uasuniwue@gmail.com)


Select your aircraft and sensor and go carefully through the instructions. You will find a link to print the documents at the end of this page. 

If you are familiar with UAS you maybe want to print the short version only.

After you decided on your system and sensors you can go to the "create" section (menu bar on the top). Filling out the form here will automatically create the folders needed to store your collected data properly.

All the flight missions of one region are stored within the same folder (= Project location), the name of the project folder is predefined (e.g. Berchtesgarden, Uniwald,...) please contact us if your region of interest is not appearing within the drop down menu (uasuniwue@gmail.com)

The folders created are: ...

explanation mission name


Projectfolder -> date_mission_name -> flights, analysis, results, media -> within flights: Aircraft_Sensor




Please note: a co-pilot is mandatory when going into the field with the M300, M600, Wingtra
