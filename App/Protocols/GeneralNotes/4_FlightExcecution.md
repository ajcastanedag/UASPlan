# Flight Excecution
==============================================


In general: 
- look for an open space and a flat surface to set up the drone, use the landing pad 
- you should choose the "highest" area of your AOI for your flight mission (more stable connection)

- Use the flags and cones to secure your start and landing spot as well as your surrounding (e.g. to warn cars/bikes when you are close to a street)

- Verify all cells in the battery are functional in the app (Prince)

- compass calibration is sometimes asked if needed
