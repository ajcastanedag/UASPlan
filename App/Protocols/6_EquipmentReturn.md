# Equipment return
==============================================

as soon as you are back at the university you should copy the data immediately to the lidar computer via the UAS app.

  1. put the equipment back to its place (you are not allowed to store it outside, e.g. the car, overnight) an crosscheck with a UAS Team member. The formula will be signed and serves as an official document 
  2. log in to lidar computer and open UAS app
  3. copy your data. make sure that the information is successfully copied
  4. clean the memories (SDcards)
  
  please note: if it was very humid outside or started raining please let the boxes open after return to let the equipment dry
